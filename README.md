Additional function in Pick-a-Poop for connecting those who's dog needs to be walked and those who can walk the dog.

#some specs

User stories: (things which user does on the app)
-Registering
-logging in
-add dog
-choose dog

How should we make this selecting work? If someone chooses the dog should it be automatically deleted from the database
or should the dog owner choose one applicant and then remove the dog from the db?
